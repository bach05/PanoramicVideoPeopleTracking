# monocular_people_tracking

This package provides a monocular vision-based people tracking method. It utilizes *tf-pose-estimation* to detect people joints, and by projecting the detected ankle onto the ground plane, it estimates the person position in the robot space. To make the estimation robust, it estimates the height of the person in addition to his/her position with Unscented Kalman Filter.

## Dependencies
